									<h3>Where I'm Working Now</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I currently work as a System Analyst Student Worker at The University of Texas at Dallas for The Office of Information Technology under the Production Support Team. An average day consists of creating a forecast report for the automative jobs that will run under a program called Control-M. Afterwards, I work with my boss to continue creating PowerShell scripts that will be later used with Control-M to automate. One specific script that I worked on is converting a large number of .doc and .docx files to .pdf files, then merging them all together into one .pdf file. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I have been working here since August of 2018 and it has great so far since, I can practice solving complex problems by using PowerShell code to help out the Production Support Team.
